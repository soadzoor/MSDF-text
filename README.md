MSDF text rendering demo

MSDF is awesome.

This scene contains The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, more than 5 million characters.
I use the three.js implementation of instanced meshes, and the popular vignette background.

I don't use any optimization, like distance-based rendering, or anything like that, yet it still runs 60 FPS on a decent hardware.

Controls:
WASD + hold with mouse
